## Issue Tracking

GitHub Issues at https://github.com/Palate-Pen/palatepen-web/issues are reserved for **bugs and problems we hit, with the fix documented inline**. Each issue should describe the symptom, the root cause once known, and the resolution (commit SHA / PR / behaviour change). Apply the `Bug` label by default; add `Website` or `Payments` if it scopes there.

The forward-looking work list lives in the Roadmap section of this file — not in Issues. Tick the box and add a Progress Log entry when something ships.

## Progress Log

When completing any roadmap item, add an entry here with the date, what was done, and any important technical notes.

### 2026-05-11

- Project initiated, full stack live
- Stripe integrated with Pro/Kitchen/Group tiers
- Palatable brand locked in (renamed from Mise)
- Admin panel built (Overview/Users/Audit/Settings, light theme, gold accent)
- Anthropic API wired server-side
- on_auth_user_created Postgres trigger: signup auto-creates user_data row (migration 001), with email backfill (002) and admin_audit_log table (003)
- Comp-tier mechanism in admin: tier dropdown (Free/Pro/Kitchen/Group) + "Free upgrade — no Stripe charge" toggle; profile.comp excluded from MRR
- Audit log: server-side audit() helper records update_user / initialize_user / delete_user / test_signup with before→after diff, viewable in Audit tab with action filter + per-user filter
- Diagnosed Next.js fetch cache issue masking admin GET reads (see Important Notes)
- Audit confirmed already-shipped Phase 1 items: stock inline editing, stock/ingredient categories, business-min-GP-bar removed from CostingView

## Known Issues

Document any bugs or issues found during development here.

## Important Notes

- All file writes use Node.js scripts to avoid Windows encoding issues
- Settings persist via localStorage key palatable_settings_v2
- App root div ID is palatable-app-root for zoom-based font scaling
- Stripe webhook endpoint: app.palateandpen.co.uk/api/stripe/webhook
- Invoice scanning requires Pro tier — checked server-side
- Demo account: jack@palateandpen.co.uk (Pro tier)
- **supabase-js + Next.js fetch cache**: supabase-js calls global `fetch()` internally, and Next.js auto-caches GET `fetch()` calls in route handlers — even with `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`. Symptom: server-side reads return phantom rows that no longer exist in Postgres. Fix: pass a custom `global.fetch` to `createClient` that wraps `fetch` with `cache: 'no-store'`. Centralized as `svc()` in `src/lib/admin.ts` — use it for any admin/server-role Supabase client. (Writes via PATCH/POST/DELETE are not cached, so this only affects GETs.)
- supabase-js `.insert(...)` without `.select()` can resolve before PostgREST commits when RLS is enabled. The shared `audit()` helper uses `.insert(...).select().single()` so the await fully round-trips.
- Sensitive Vercel env vars (Stripe, Supabase service role, Anthropic) cannot be pulled to local `.env.local`. To run admin/server routes locally that need them, paste manually. Pulled values come back as empty strings.
